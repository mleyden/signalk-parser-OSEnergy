# Signal-k Support files


This folder contains files often used with Signal-k.  
Copy these files into your existing ```signalk-server-node``` folder.


To run an example, use the following command from your signal-server-node directory:  ``  ./bin/osenergy-from-file``

(You may have to set the executable permission flag 1st, ```chmod 755 ./bin/osenergy-from-file```  - until I can figure out the workaround for a Github/windows permission issue)


Then try opening a web browser and going to: ```http://localhost:3000/instrumentpanel/```
